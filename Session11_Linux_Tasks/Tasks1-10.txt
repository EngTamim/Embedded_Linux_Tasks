The resolv.conf file is a configuration file used by the Domain Name System (DNS) resolver on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It is used to configure the behavior of the DNS resolver library, which is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
The resolv.conf file is typically located in the /etc directory, and its settings are used by various DNS-aware applications on the system. It's important to note that changes to the resolv.conf file take effect immediately without requiring a system restart. However, some network management tools might dynamically update this file based on network changes.
//********************************************************************************************

Task2:
fstab file:
The /etc/fstab file in Linux is a system configuration file that defines how disk drives, partitions, and other block devices should be mounted into the file system. The acronym "fstab" stands for "file system table." This file is read by the mount command at boot time or when a system administrator manually mounts or remounts file systems.
The fstab file is crucial for proper system operation, as it determines which file systems are automatically mounted during the boot process. Incorrect entries or missing devices in fstab can lead to boot failures or other issues. It's important to edit this file with caution, and changes typically require administrative privileges. Additionally, modern Linux distributions may use tools like systemd to handle mounting, and the fstab file may not be the sole source of mount information.

Purpose:
.bashrc is a per-user configuration file that is executed every time an interactive Bash shell is launched.

Usage:
Typically used for defining user-specific settings, environment variables, and command aliases.
Commonly used for customizing the shell prompt, setting environment variables, and defining functions and aliases.

When It's Executed:
Executed for each interactive non-login shell session.

Location:
Located in the user's home directory (~/.bashrc).
-------------------------------------------------------------------
.bash_profile file:
Purpose:
.bash_profile is a per-user configuration file that is executed only during the login process when the user logs into the system.

Usage:
Used for settings that should be executed only once during the user's login, such as setting environment variables, running commands, or printing messages.

When It's Executed:
Executed only for the first interactive login shell session.

Location:
Also located in the user's home directory (~/.bash_profile).
If .bash_profile is not present, Bash may look for .bash_login or .profile and execute the first one it finds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Differences:
Execution Frequency:
.bashrc is executed for every interactive non-login shell session.
.bash_profile is executed only once during the first interactive login shell session.

Use Case:
.bashrc is often used for settings that need to be applied for each shell session.
.bash_profile is used for settings that are specific to the login process and need to be executed only once during login.

Login Shells:
.bashrc is sourced by every interactive non-login shell.
.bash_profile is sourced by the login shell.

Default Configurations:
Some Linux distributions may be configured to automatically source .bashrc from .bash_profile to ensure consistency across login and non-login shells.

In practice, users often customize both files to suit their needs. It's common to have .bash_profile source .bashrc to ensure that settings defined in .bashrc are also applied

DISPLAY Variable:
The DISPLAY variable in Linux is an environment variable that specifies the X server display to which graphical applications should connect. The X server is a software component that provides the foundation for the graphical user interface in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.

The primary purpose of the DISPLAY variable is to inform graphical applications about the location and configuration of the X server, enabling them to display their graphical user interfaces on the user's screen.

The DISPLAY variable has the following format:
hostname:displaynumber.screennumber

hostname: Specifies the name of the machine where the X server is running. If omitted, it defaults to the local machine.
displaynumber: Specifies the number of the X server. This is usually 0 for the first X server on the machine.
screennumber: Specifies the number of the physical screen to use on the specified X server. It is often 0.

Examples:
Local Display:
If the X server is running on the local machine and is the default (usually :0), the DISPLAY variable is typically set to :0.
DISPLAY=:0

Remote Display:
If you are running a graphical application on one machine but displaying it on another, you might set the DISPLAY variable like this:
DISPLAY=remotehostname:0

Use Cases:
Launching GUI Applications:
Graphical applications use the DISPLAY variable to determine where to render their graphical interface.

Remote Display:
When using remote desktop or X forwarding, the DISPLAY variable is set to display the graphical application on the user's local machine.

X Authority:
In addition to the DISPLAY variable, the X server uses an authentication mechanism called X authority (Xauthority file) to control which clients (applications) are allowed to connect to the X server.

Display Managers:
Display managers, such as GDM (GNOME Display Manager) or LightDM, handle the setup of the X server and often set the DISPLAY variable for user sessions.
